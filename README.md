# django-forms3

Use the project attached to this repo. Create a Memphis Non-Profit app that will take a non-profit name, address, established date, operating budget, and number of employees. It's up to the developer what kind of data type each attribute takes. I kept all the previous information in the database. Fix the model to fit these new needs. Make sure the user can see all non-profits and add/edit non-profits from the frontend.

Note:
username = admin
password = test123
